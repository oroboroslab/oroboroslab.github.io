                <h3>Dual-AI Architecture (2AI System)</h3>
                <p>OROBOROS OS introduces a revolutionary approach to AI computing with two AI systems working in tandem. This architecture provides unprecedented capability while maintaining safety and reliability.</p>

                <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary AI (Executor):</strong> Handles task execution, content generation, code writing, and direct user interactions. This AI focuses on getting work done efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary AI (Overseer):</strong> Monitors the Primary AI's outputs, validates results, catches errors, and ensures quality. Acts as a built-in quality assurance layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consensus Protocol:</strong> For critical operations, both AIs must agree before proceeding. This prevents errors and ensures reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Escalation:</strong> When AIs disagree or detect uncertainty, the system automatically flags for human review.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Benefits of Dual-AI</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced errors through AI-to-AI verification</li>
                        <li>Higher quality outputs with built-in review</li>
                        <li>Automatic detection of hallucinations and mistakes</li>
                        <li>Increased confidence in AI-generated content</li>
                        <li>Transparent decision-making with audit trails</li>
